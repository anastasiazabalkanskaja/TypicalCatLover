<p>The Maine Coon is a large domesticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon">cat breed</a>. It has a distinctive physical appearance and valuable hunting skills. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America, specifically native to the US state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.

<h3 id="1-feed-your-maine-coon-nutritious-food">1. FEED YOUR MAINE COON NUTRITIOUS FOOD</h3>
<p>Given a Maine Coon’s large body and active nature, it’s important to feed the feline sufficient nutritious food. Dry food (or kibble) usually forms an integral part of a cat’s diet, and this is supplemented by wet food.</p>
<p>There’s no exact formula to what and when to feed a Maine Coon. Some cat owners practice free-feeding by giving their cat unlimited access to kibble. They only offer wet food two or three times a week.

<h3 id="2-give-your-main-coon-a-supply-of-clean-water">2. GIVE YOUR MAIN COON A SUPPLY OF CLEAN WATER</h3>
<p>This hardly needs to be said. Provide your Maine Coon continuous supply of water in a clean bowl. Maine Coons are known to love drinking water – they may even try to drink right out of the faucet!
<img src="https://purrcraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cat-3879979_1280.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<h3 id="3-prepare-a-large-litter-box-or-two">3. PREPARE A LARGE LITTER BOX OR TWO</h3>
<p>You can avoid messy mishaps by choosing the right litter boxes and placing them in a suitable location. Maine Coons require large litter boxes that give them enough space to poop and move around while burying their excretions.</p>
<p>As to where to place the litter box, don’t assume that your Maine Coon wants privacy while doing its business. Some do, of course, but others prefer to have it at the corner of the kitchen or the living room.</p>
<p>You might need some experimentation to figure out where your cat prefers its litter box. Just don’t place it beside its food or a noisy appliance like a washing machine.</p>
<h3 id="4-give-your-maine-coon-exercise">4. GIVE YOUR MAINE COON EXERCISE</h3>
<p>The plus-sized Maine Coons are imbued with high levels of energy. Its muscular, athletic bodies need to spend all that excess energy through exercise. Known for its crepuscular nature, Coon cats are typically most active during dawn and dusk.</p>
<p>To keep your Maine Coon healthy (and to avoid waking nights), you should give it room to be active in the daytime. Some Maine Coons also enjoy being taken on walks, just like dogs. For this activity, you will need to start slow – get your cat used to wearing a harness and walk it around the house before attempting to go further.</p>
